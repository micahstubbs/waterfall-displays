  #canvas {
    width: 960px; 
    height: auto;

Small side project to play about with the idea of waterfall graphs.
This drew on code from Jos Dirksen's excellent page [here](http://www.smartjava.org/content/exploring-html5-web-audio-visualizing-sound).

Because it tries to access the microphone you will need to access it using https and to allow the use of the microphone.
